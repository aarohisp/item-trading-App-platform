## Before raising a PR, run the lint checks in the following order.

1- yarn run format:check (If any issues found, let prettier format the codebase).  
2- yarn run format:write (recheck after this step by running format:check).  
3- yarn run lint:check (to check any linting problems in the code.)  
4- yarn run lint:fix (It will specify where there might have been any programming styling errors).

Fix these issues if raised by the linting tools and raise a PR.
